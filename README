Product Marketplace Dashboard - UI Mockup
Overview
This is a frontend UI mockup for a Product Marketplace Dashboard with role-based access control. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it demonstrates a modern SaaS-style interface for managing products through an approval workflow.

This mockup serves as a visual prototype and functional demonstration of how users with different roles interact with the product management system. It's designed to integrate with a backend API (like the Django REST Framework backend).

Features Implemented
Core Functionality

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Four user roles with different permissions:
Admin – Full access (view, create, edit, approve, manage users)
Editor – Can create and edit products
Approver – Can view and approve/reject products
Viewer – Read-only access to products
Product Management
Product listing with filtering (All, Approved, Pending, Draft)
Create new products with form validation
Edit existing products (role-dependent)
Product status workflow: draft → pending → approved
Visual status badges with color coding
Approval Workflow
Dedicated approvals page for Admin and Approver roles
Approve/Reject actions with confirmation modals
Real-time pending count badge in navigation
Dashboard Analytics
Statistics cards showing product counts by status
Recent activity feed
Visual metrics with percentage changes
UI/UX Features
Responsive Design – Mobile-first approach with collapsible sidebar
Modern Aesthetics – Clean, professional SaaS styling with gradients and shadows
Interactive Elements:
Toast notifications for user actions
Confirmation modals for critical actions
Hover effects and smooth transitions
Form validation with inline error messages
Customizable Branding – Company name, welcome messages, and colors can be edited via Canva's edit panel
Technologies Used
HTML5 – Semantic markup structure
Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
Vanilla JavaScript – No framework dependencies for core functionality
Google Fonts – Plus Jakarta Sans for modern typography
Canva Elements SDK – For edit panel integration and customization
Setup Instructions

Option 1: Using Live Server (VS Code Extension)
Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
Right-click the HTML file
Select "Open with Live Server"
Option 2:Run Locally
Save the HTML file to your local machine
Open the file directly in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
No build tools or server required – it's a single self-contained HTML file

Demo Usage
On the login screen, click any role button (Admin, Editor, Approver, Viewer)
Navigate through different sections using the sidebar menu
Try creating products, filtering lists, and approving items (based on role permissions)

Tech Decisions & Assumptions
Architecture Decisions
Single-page application (SPA) – All views managed client-side with JavaScript
No external API – Uses in-memory sample data for demonstration purposes
Self-contained file – All CSS and JavaScript inline for portability
Tailwind CSS via CDN – Rapid prototyping without build step

Design Patterns
Role-based UI rendering – Navigation items show/hide based on user permissions
Component-based structure – Reusable card components and modals
State management – Simple global state object for user, view, and filter state
Event-driven actions – DOM manipulation triggered by user interactions
Styling Approach
Design System – Consistent color palette with semantic naming:
Background (#f9fafb) – Main page background
Surface (#ffffff) – Card and panel backgrounds
Text (#111827) – Primary text color
Primary Action (#3b82f6) – Buttons and CTAs
Secondary Action (#6b7280) – Secondary buttons and links
Accessibility – WCAG 2 AA compliant color contrasts, keyboard navigation support
Custom animations – Smooth transitions for modals, toasts, and hover states

Assumptions
Authentication is mocked – Login is simulated; no real authentication backend
Data persistence – Product data exists only in memory (resets on page reload)
Sample products – Pre-populated with 8 example products for demonstration
Browser compatibility – Modern browsers with ES6+ support required

Known Limitations
No Backend Integration – This is a frontend mockup only; all data is client-side
To integrate with your Django backend, replace the sample products array with API calls
Implement authentication flow with JWT or session tokens
Add error handling for network requests
No Data Persistence – Refreshing the page resets all changes
Consider integrating the Data SDK (included but not used in current version)
Or connect to your backend API for real persistence
Limited Form Validation – Basic client-side validation only
Server-side validation should be implemented in backend
Consider adding more robust field validation (email format, price ranges, etc.)
No Image Upload – Product images are represented by placeholder SVG icons
Implement file upload functionality when connecting to backend
Consider image optimization and CDN storage
Single Language Support – Interface is in English only
Internationalization (i18n) would require restructuring text content
No Search Functionality – Search input is present but not functional
Implement client-side filtering or server-side search when connecting to API
